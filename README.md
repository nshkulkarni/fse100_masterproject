# Rapid Recovery Project -- FSE 100

  Rapid Recovery is an app designed for FMS patients that suffered a stroke and want to regain their motor skills. The goal of the app is to offer a selection of exercises that are fun, engaging, and help users recover at their own pace. Rapid Recovery offers three choices that can be seen in the main menu: the tapping game, maze, and the tracing game. 
  The first of the three exercises is a simple game of tapping all the shapes that are given to the user and once they do the shapes disappear and points are rewarded. The game is over once all the shapes are tapped. 
The second exercise requires a steady hand and focus to first find the way out and then to make sure to stay on the path and not touch the margins that make up the maze. 
  The last exercise is one that also requires the user to be focused on the task. A shape is given as well as a start and end point and the goal of the game is to trace the shape entirely without going outside the boundaries of the shape. All three games help recovering FMS patients fine tune their finger mobility at a pace that is for them.

  The mainMenu.js file is a file that includes the code to the menu screen that displays the buttons to navigate our app. The main menu should display buttons with hyperlinks.

  The maze.js file is a file that includes the code to our maze game in p5js. The maze game should display feedback when a user goes out of bounds.

  The tapping.js file is a file that includes the code to our circle tapping game in p5js. When the circles are tapped within bounds, the score should increment. When all circles are tapped the game should exit.

  The tracing.js file is a file that includes the codes to our shape tracing game in p5js. The game should display feeback when a user goes out of bounds.
